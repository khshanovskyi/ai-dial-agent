# DIAL Agent Implementation

## üéØ Task Overview

With this task you will create AI agent with custom tool, MCP tools and DIAL deployment tools, practice with streaming
in Choice and Stage in DIAL Chat.

## üéì Learning Goals

By completing this project, you will learn:

- **AI Agent Architecture**: Building intelligent agents that can orchestrate multiple tools
- **Tool Orchestration**: Combining MCP tools, custom tools and deployment-based tools (web search, image generation)
- **Streaming & Real-time Processing**: Handling streaming responses and real-time tool execution
- **DIAL Integration**: Working with DIAL API for AI model interactions


## üìã Requirements

- **Python**: 3.11 or higher
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerized deployment
- **API Access**:
    - DIAL API key with appropriate permissions
    - EPAM VPN connection for internal API access
- **Optional**: Postman for API testing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. API Configuration

1. **Connect to EPAM VPN** (required for internal API access)
2. **Obtain DIAL API Key** from EPAM support and set it as env `DIAL_API_KEY` variable
3. **Set environment variables**:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Task 7: Check that DIAL is working locally
- Run [task/app.py](task/app.py) locally
- Open http://localhost:3000/
- Test that GPT model is available and provides responses
- Test Super Agent application:
    ```text
    Hi, what can you do?
    ```
- Try to call calculator tool:
    ```text
    Calculate 495903.928834 * 39483.1038472
    ```
- Try to analyze picture (you need to upload picture for analyze, in Core configuration we allowed uploading `png` and `jpeg` files):
    ```text
    What do you see here?
    ```
